# sakemodels
The models in this repository encompass all three possible cases of the state difference between the initiator and the responder before the start of the SAKE protocol.
Either the initiator is one step behind, in sync with or one step ahead of the responder, as is also apparent from the naming of the files. 
Please run the models in Tamarin Prover for the proofs corresponding to the security properties fulfilled by the protocol.
